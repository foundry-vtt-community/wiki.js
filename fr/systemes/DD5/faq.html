<p><span class="text-big"><strong>B. </strong></span><strong>Where is the non-SRD Content?</strong></p>
<p>Only content within the D&amp;D 5e SRD can be freely distributed and included in the system. You can view the SRD here: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/WotC-SRD">https://tinyurl.com/WotC-SRD</a></p>
<p>Anything outside of the SRD needs to be brought into Foundry. There are a few ways to accomplish this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Purchase Official Modules. Current offerings include the <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dnd-players-handbook">Player's Handbook (2024)</a>, <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dnd-tashas-cauldron">Tasha's Cauldron of Everything</a> and <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dnd-phandelver-below">Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk</a>, over time more official content will be released.</li>
  <li>Create the class features/items/monsters yourself. This might sound daunting, but once you get the hang of Foundry it's pretty simple and easy. Especially since you can drag-and-drop features from existing content from the SRD compendiums! This greatly helps to give you a good understanding of how the features work in Foundry.<br>For PCs <strong>alaustin</strong> has created a playlist of videos to guide you through creating Class Features, Class and Subclass items, and best practices on where to store them: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/alaustindnd5e">https://tinyurl.com/alaustindnd5e</a><br>We recommended that if you take this approach, only create things as you need them to keep things quick and simple. For example, only create the features for the subclass your players are choosing, rather than trying to complete all subclasses at once.</li>
  <li>If you have access to the content on D&amp;D Beyond, you can use the D&amp;DBeyond Importer module. The biggest downside to this approach is that it is easier to get confused about how exactly the features work within Foundry since the work has been done for you, but it's really down to how much you prioritize your time vs your money. See Section <strong>J</strong> below, for more information.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="text-big"><strong>C. </strong></span><strong>Are there pre-made adventures for purchase or for free?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely, many content creators have made wonderful adventures that can be installed and ran with minimal setup on your end.</p>

<p><span class="text-big"><strong>D. </strong></span><strong>What modules do I need?</strong></p>
<p>No modules are required to run and play DnD5e in Foundry, but there is a wide variety of modules available.&nbsp;<br>We do not provide a list of "generally recommended modules" because everyone plays their game differently, there are users that run with less than 10 modules, and users that run with over 100. We recommend never blindly installing modules from a list another user provides, as they may or may not be relevant to your needs and wants. Adding modules to your game also means added complexity, so it is always recommended to read a module's documentation prior to install to make sure you are familiar with what it provides and how it works. Using modules that you have not taken the time to personally vet is likely to lead to issues with configuration and troubleshooting down the line. We strongly recommend getting comfortable with the base DnD5e system's capabilities. Once you are familiar with what features come out of the box, then we are happy to provide recommendations if you are seeking solutions for a specific feature you are looking for, e.g. "I want to see 3D dice roll across my screen when using features or rolling damage" "I would recommend Dice So Nice for that"</p>

<p><span class="text-big"><strong>E. </strong></span><strong>How can I automate items/spells/features?</strong></p>
<p>The goal of the DnD5e system is to replicate the tabletop experience, by integrating the SRD content and rules into the game system.<br>The core implementation for some level of automation is the use of Active Effects.<br>First, take a look at the github wiki's guide to core Active Effects, there is a good amount of customization you can do <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e/wiki/Active-Effect-Guide">https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e/wiki/Active-Effect-Guide</a></p>
<p>Luckily the DnD5e community has a robust offering of modules that can assist you in spending every waking moment trying to figure out how to automate some weird niche use case that you cant live without.<br>You are welcome to ask questions and discuss these modules in the dnd5e channel of course. However, these modules will not be discussed here in the FAQ as we do not wish to imply that any of these modules are recommended, and each users preferred modules and configurations are unique.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also be interested in joining the Posney's Foundry Automation server for even more automation discussion related to MidiQOL and its associated modules: <a href="https://discord.gg/Xd4NEvw5d7">https://discord.gg/Xd4NEvw5d7</a></p>

<p><span class="text-big"><strong>F. </strong></span><strong>How to: Wildshape/Polymorph</strong></p>
<p>To use the built-in Wild Shape feature, open the character sheet of the actor that you would like to transform, then drag the actor they should transform into onto that character sheet (e.g. open the Druid's character sheet and drag the Wolf actor onto it). In the resulting pop-up dialog, click the Wild Shape button. This must be done by the Gamemaster, unless the System Setting "Allow Polymorphing" is enabled, the player must also have "Observer" access to the actors they can transform into and the permissions to "Create New Actors" and "Create New Tokens". To exit Wild Shape, open the actor sheet and click the Restore Transformation button in the sheet's title bar. Because Players cannot have permissions to delete actors, if used by a player the transformed actor will remain, if used by the Gamemaster the transformed actor will be deleted.</p>
<p>Unsoluble has a great video guide available here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjcugG_akk4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjcugG_akk4</a><br>(As of 2.1.0 Unlinked Tokens can use the Restore Transformation feature, this video was recorded prior to version 2.1.0)</p>

<p><span class="text-big"><strong>G. </strong></span><strong>How to: Create Spell Scrolls</strong></p>
<p>There are two ways to create a Spell Scroll from a spell, either by using the Right Click context menu and using the "Create Scroll" option or by dragging a Spell onto an Actor's Inventory tab. A dialog will be displayed with options as to what description should be shown and what levels the spell should be created at (defaults to the spell's base level). A reference to the spell scroll rules or their entire text from the SRD rules will be added to the spell's description.</p>

<p><span class="text-big"><strong>H. </strong></span><strong>Making changes to the system with World Scripts</strong></p>
<p>If you are looking to make a change to the system that isn't provided by an existing feature or module, such as increasing the Maximum Level Cap, adding Damage types, and more, you want to create a World Script. A World Script is similar to a macro, but is executed automatically when the world is loaded, based on what you hook onto. More information about their use, how to configure them, and example scripts is available on the github repo here: <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e/wiki/Modifying-Your-Game-with-Scripts">https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e/wiki/Modifying-Your-Game-with-Scripts</a></p>

<p><span class="text-big"><strong>I. </strong></span><strong>D&amp;DBeyond Importer Module</strong></p>
<p>The D&amp;DBeyond Importer module can be used to import the content you have access to on DnDBeyond into Foundry. This includes Characters, Spells, Items, Monsters, Adventures, Encounters, Classes, and Races. <strong>Note that Monster importing requires a patreon subscription or setting up your own proxy service.</strong><br>For an overview of what features the module provides, and a link to download the module manifest, see the Foundry Package listing here: <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ddb-importer">https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ddb-importer</a></p>

<p><span class="text-big"><strong>J. </strong></span><strong>Reverting to a previous System version and Restoring from a Backup</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/MaxPat931/a05b6d5727b953f1c14cf568018f2fba#restoring-from-a-backup">This guide</a> assumes that you have made a Backup of your world prior to launching it in the new system version (Foundry will prompt you to make this <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/backups/">backup</a> automatically)</p>
<p>Uninstall dnd5e, and install a previous version's manifest URL from the <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e/releases">Releases</a> page.<br>Then head to your Worlds, right click on the world and Restore Latest Backup or Manage Backup and choose the backup to restore from. Keep in mind you may also need to revert any modules you have updated as well.</p>
