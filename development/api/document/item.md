### Containers

A common request within Foundry is being able to embed items within other items, e.g. putting a bedroll in a backpack. Unfortunately, the underlying database validation does not permit this, but you can accomplish containers with some rendering logic to hide items within a container while still keeping them adjacent in the parent collection.

### Item Grants

Many systems have implemented a "Item Grants". In short, this is a way for Items to add other items, such as an RPG class adding class features.
