## Overview
The data model is the root of how Foundry synchronizes information between the client and server. It includes functions for:

- Cleaning data
- Validating data
- Migrating data
- Keeping what's saved to the database separate from what's served to developers

**As a System developer**: Data models can entirely replace the type-specific field initialization of the `template.json`; the [dnd5e](https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e/blob/master/template.json) system is an example of how much you can trim down that file, letting the data model do the rest.

**As a Module developer**: Data models are necessary for [Module Sub-Types](https://foundryvtt.com/article/module-sub-types/), where you provide your own new type of Actor, Item, JournalEntry, or other document sub-type. 

--- 
## Key Concepts

Working with data models doesn't have to be daunting - almost all of the functionality is provided just by extending the appropriate `DataModel` class. (System and module developers usually want to start by extending `foundry.abstract.TypeDataModel`)

### \_source vs. initialized properties

Data models keep two copies of their stored data; a database-friendly version under `_source`, and then the "initialized" properties at the top level of the data model. For example, `Actor#_source.folder` is a `string` that references the ID of the containing folder, while `Actor#folder` is a pointer to the folder instance. `Actor#_source.items` is an array, `Actor#items` is a `Collection`. Foundry usually intelligently handles either type when passing in data that matches either format in a `create` or `update` call, but core bugs in this handling do exist and your own code may need to keep these differences in mind.

**IN GENERAL** You do not need to interact with the data in `_source` - it has NOT been put through the `prepareData` cycle. However, `DataModel#toObject()` by default returns the contents of `_source`, and even invoking `toObject(false)` will still give the data structure of source (arrays and objects instead of sets, maps, and collections) but with the post-`prepareData` values.

### The Schema

The one piece of information you MUST provide is the `static defineSchema()` method, which returns an key-value record where every value is a subclass of DataField. Foundry makes many of these subclasses available at `foundry.data.fields`, so it's common practice to lead a schema definition with `const fields = foundry.data.fields`. The following diagram provides some details on the inheritance

```md
DataField
	SchemaField
  	EmbeddedDataField
    	EmbeddedDocumentField
    DocumentStatsField
  BooleanField
  NumberField
  	AngleField
    AlphaField
    HueField
    IntegerSortField
  StringField
  	DocumentIdField
    	ForeignDocumentField
    DocumentUUIDField
    ColorField
    FilePathField
    JSONField
    HTMLField
    JavaScriptField
    DocumentTypeField
  ObjectField
  	DocumentOwnershipField
    TypeDataField
  ArrayField
  	SetField
    EmbeddedCollectionField
    	EmbeddedCollectionDeltaField
  AnyField
  TypedSchemaField
```

You don't have to use the most nested versions of a field; in fact, it's frequently better not to â€” `StringField` works great by itself. Furthermore, several of these fields are NOT for system and module developers (e.g. `EmbeddedCollectionField` and `EmbeddedDocumentField`), as they require server-side support: This isn't a clever way to do "items within items".

These fields are defined in `yourFoundryInstallPath\resources\app\common\data\fields.mjs` as well as the [official API docs](https://foundryvtt.com/api/modules/foundry.data.fields.html).

#### SchemaField vs. EmbeddedDataField

These two fields serve a similar purpose: They allow you to nest properties, so you can have `doc.system.myProp.fieldOne` and `doc.system.myProp.fieldTwo`. The difference is that `SchemaField` creates a nested object, while `EmbeddedDataField` is a full class instance. This can be useful if you want to have getters or other functions nested deeper than `doc.system.myFunc` - you could have  `doc.system.embedField.myFunc`. The downside is certain interactions, such as the javascript spread operator `{ ... }`, may not work as expected because it is a full class instance rather than a simple object.

### DataField options

There's quite a few options you can pass to DataField, which are officially documented [here](https://foundryvtt.com/api/interfaces/foundry.data.fields.DataFieldOptions.html). However, the most common change in a subclass is its handling of the options and what the defaults are. 

You can see a complete overview of DataFields and how they override or expand options summarized in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS1bbPl6AzD4wzrGWRk_r1CHfOeqj70mCo2fbrbWc9nYuyP7uIL6LOMxRFR2BoEMDRZb4stxhqJ2T0P/pubhtml). On it, asterixes mark how many levels of inheritance up the source of the value comes from, and underlined values indicated values forced in that field's constructor.

Here's some important information to know about each option:

##### `required` and `nullable`

*Default*: `required: false` and `nullable: false`

These two options control `_validateSpecial`; `required` prevents passing an undefined value, while `nullable` allows a `null` value. The important difference is that `null` will *not* be overridden by `initial` but `undefined` will always be replaced by an initial value if it is present.

**blank**: In StringField and its subclasses, `blank` operates on a similar level to `required` and `nullable` by controlling if `''` is a valid value; it's even checked at the same step with `_validateSpecial`. By default, `blank` is true EXCEPT if `choices` is provided, in which case `blank` defaults to false. Also, basically every StringField subclass sets `blank: false` in its defaults.

##### `initial`

*Default*: `undefined`

In addition to being a static value, this can be a function which takes in the entire data model as an argument and returns a value. If `required` is true and there's no `initial` value, this will create errors if the field is not passed in the constructor.

`StringField` and its descendants modify the default slightly; if you pass `required: true, blank: true`, that's equivalent to also passing `initial: ""`.

#### `readonly`

*Default*: `false`

This option prevents a field from being changed after initial creation. Readonly fields can still be altered by `Document#_preCreate` and the `preCreateDocument` hook, and can be dynamically set if `initial` is a function.

#### `validate` and `validationError`

*Default*: `validate: undefined` and `validationError: "is not a valid value"`

If defined, `validate` should have the signature `(value, options) => boolean`; returning false is functionally the same as throwing a `DataModelValidationFailure`. This can be useful when you don't want to entirely define a new DataField subclass but do want a bit of additional handling, such as enforcing that a `StringField` is all lowercase with no special characters. The second argument, `options`, is [documented here](https://foundryvtt.com/api/interfaces/foundry.data.fields.DataFieldValidationOptions.html).

The `validationError` option can be used with or without the `validate` option; it simply replaces the default console errors generated on a type validation failure. Many data field subclasses replace the default string with more specific language.

#### `label` and `hint`

*Default*: `""` (for both) 

These fields are used by the [formInptut and formField](/en/development/api/helpers#forminput-and-formfield) handlebars helpers. If you implement [LOCALIZATION_PREFIXES](/en/development/api/localization#localization_prefixes) you don't need to manually define them, instead you can just structure your `en.json` file to provide the appropriate info.

#### Other Options

DataField subclasses sometimes take additional options. These are always in addition to the baseline DataFieldOptions.

- [NumberFieldOptions](https://foundryvtt.com/api/modules/foundry.data.fields.html#NumberFieldOptions)
- [StringFieldParams](https://foundryvtt.com/api/interfaces/foundry.data.fields.StringFieldParams.html)
- [FilePathFieldOptions](https://foundryvtt.com/api/modules/foundry.data.fields.html#FilePathFieldOptions)

### DataModel#constructor 

Developers generally don't need to know the ins and outs of how `new DataModel` works. In case you do, the following summarizes the steps that occur using a `new Actor` as an example. For reference, `Actor extends ClientDocumentMixin(BaseActor)`, and `BaseActor extends Document extends DataModel`, so there are five distinct layers of inheritance happening.

`Actor` doesn't override the `constructor`, but `ClientDocumentMixin` does; that calls `super` and then instantiates the `apps` record and the `_sheet` pointer. The super call skips through `BaseActor` and `Document`, as neither override the constructor, landing us in `DataModel#constructor`. Within this function several steps happen:

1. `_source` is set to the return of `_initializeSource`
2. `_configure` is called
3. `validate` is called
4. `_initialize` is called

The following sections explain each of those function calls. Whenever a data model is *updated*, only `validate` and `_initialize` are called, as the first two define many read-only properties.

#### DataModel#\_initializeSource

`Actor#_initializeSource` routes to `BaseActor#_initializeSource`, which calls `super` then sets up some default `prototypeToken` properties. Otherwise, the relevant pieces are in `DataModel`, which checks that the source data provided is an object then calls `migrateDataSafe`, `cleanData`, and `shimData`. Importantly, these changes are at the lowest level of the data model and safeguard the data that is actually saved to the database.

**migrateDataSafe**: An error-checking wrapper for `migrateData`, this moves old data loaded from the database into new formats (this is a synchronous operation; the moves are not saved back to the database automatically). `DataModel#migrateData` calls `this.schema.migrateSource()`, which ripples down to trigger migrations on any embedded data models such as `Actor#system`.

**cleanData**: This just calls `schema.clean`, which propagates calls to all the fields to run `_cast` and `_cleanType`. For example, NumberField constricts the value to any provided `min` or `max` values, `StringField` will `trim` the input, and generally the DataFields attempt type coercion.

**shimData**: This is where Foundry adds pointers like `Actor#data` pointing to `Actor#system` with their deprecation warnings getter/setters.

#### DataModel#\_configure

This function defines all sorts of additional pointers and getters necessary to make the data model function. Data Model does not natively do anything here, it's strictly for subclasses. `Actor#_configure` calls `super` then defines its `_dependentTokens`; in `Document#_configure`, the document's collection relationships are setup, both where it can be found as well as any embedded collections it might have.

#### DataModel#validate

This method is similar to `cleanData` but is more thorough, allowing things like joint validation rules where multiple fields are considered together. A simple example of this is folders checking that their parent pointer is not pointing to themselves, checking the `folder` property against the `_id` property.

#### DataModel#\_initialize

This method copies data from the `_source` field to the top level of the data model. For `Actor`, the soonest layer of inheritance is `ClientDocument`, which calls `super` before kicking off the `prepareData` cycle; for more on that, check out [From Load to Render](/en/development/guides/from-load-to-render).

## API Interactions

Beyond their class definitions, there's a few other things to know with data models. More interactions can be found on the [Document](/en/development/api/document) page.

### Registering Data Models

Document data models MUST be registered in an init hook.

```js
// Example of importing the relevant Data model classes
// Later sections have worked implementations of these models
import { PawnData, HeroData, VillainData } from "./module/data.mjs"

Hooks.once("init", () => {
  // Use Object.assign over foundry.utils.mergeObject to preserve static properties 
  Object.assign(CONFIG.Actor.dataModels, {
    // The keys are the types defined in our template.json
    pawn: PawnData,
    hero: HeroData,
    villain: VillainData
  })
  // You can repeat with other document types, e.g. CONFIG.Item.dataModels
})
```

### Examples of DataField usage

The various data fields may be a bit obscure, so here are a few examples for each field of where they're

- SchemaField: `ChatMessage#speaker`, `Scene#grid`
- BooleanField: `ActiveEffect#disabled`, `Card#drawn`
- NumberField: `Combatant#initiative`, `Token#width`
- StringField: `Actor#name`, `Actor#type`
- ObjectField: `Actor#flags`
- ArrayField: `ActiveEffect#changes`, `Card#faces`
- SetField: `ActiveEffect#statuses`, `BasePackage#esmodules`
- EmbeddedDataField: `Actor#prototypeToken`, `Drawing#shape`
- EmbeddedCollectionField: `Actor#items`, `Combat#combatants`
- EmbeddedCollectionDeltaField: `ActorDelta#items`, `ActorDelta#effects`
- EmbeddedDocumentField: `Token#delta` (Technically an instance of `ActorDeltaField`, which extends EmbeddedDocumentField)
- DocumentIdField: `Actor#_id`, `Item#_id`
- ForeignDocumentField: `Actor#folder`, `User#character`
- ColorField: `Folder#color`, `ActiveEffect#tint`
- FilePathField: `Actor#img`, `ChatMessage#sound`
- AngleField: `Drawing#rotation`, `MeasuredTemplate#direction`
- AlphaField: `AmbientSound#volume`, `Token#alpha`
- DocumentOwnershipField: `Actor#ownership`, `Item#ownership`
- JSONField: `Setting#value`
- HTMLField: `ActiveEffect#description`, `ChatMessage#content`
- IntegerSortField: `Actor#sort`, `Item#sort`
- DocumentStatsField: `Actor#_stats`, `Item#_stats`
- TypeDataField: `Actor#system`, `Item#system`

`EmbeddedCollectionField`, `EmbeddedCollectionDeltaField`, and `EmbeddedDocumentField` are for use by Foundry staff only.

## Specific Use Cases

There's lots of great benefits of working with data models

### Migrating from template.json

Classically, Foundry uses the `templates` object to define shared properties. `DataModel.defineSchema()` allows you to use standard [object-oriented principles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_programming) to define inheritance. 

The official [Introduction to System Development](https://foundryvtt.com/article/system-development/) article provides the following snippet of a template.json as an example:
```json
"Actor": {
  "types": ["hero", "pawn", "villain"],
  "templates": {
    "background": {
      "biography": "",
      "hairColor": "blue"
    },
    "resources": {
      "health": {
        "min": 0,
        "value": 10,
        "max": 10
      },
      "power": {
        "min": 0,
        "value": 1,
        "max": 3
      }
    }
  },
  "hero": {
    "templates": ["background", "resources"],
    "goodness": {
      "value": 5,
      "max": 10
    }
  },
  "pawn": {
    "templates": ["resources"]
  },
  "villain": {
    "templates": ["background", "resources"],
    "wickedness": {
      "value": 5,
      "max": 100
    }
  }
},
```

With a data model, we have two non-mutually exclusive options

1. Define a hierarchy of inheritance where we call `super.defineSchema()`
2. Define functions that return valid schema objects we can mix in

For example, we could structure it like this

```js

// I threw this at the top of the file because we're re-using it lots of places
// but you probably want to break all of these class and function definitions up
// and can just stick this inside `defineSchema`
const fields = foundry.data.fields;

// Example of a helper function that allows us to minimize repetition
// You could also wrap the return object in `new SchemaField()`
function resourceField(initialValue, initialMax) {
  return {
		// Make sure to call new so you invoke the constructor!
    min: new fields.NumberField({ initial: 0 }),
    value: new fields.NumberField({ initial: initialValue }),
    max: new fields.NumberField({ initial: initialMax }),
  };
}

class CommonActorData extends foundry.abstract.TypeDataModel {
	static defineSchema() {
    // Note that the return is just a simple object
  	return {
      resources: new fields.SchemaField({
  			// Whenever you want to have nested objects, wrap it in SchemaField
      	health: new SchemaField(resourceField(10, 10)),
        power: new SchemaField(resourceField(1, 3))
      })
    }
  }
}

// Pawns would just have the basic resources but then you could add additional methods
class PawnData extends CommonActorData {} 

class CharacterData extends CommonActorData {
	static defineSchema() {
    // CharacterData inherits those resource fields
  	const commonData = super.defineSchema();
    return {
      // Using destructuring to effectively append our additional data here
    	...commonData,
      background: new fields.SchemaField({
        // Example of using a specialized field, in this case to help with sanitation
        biography: new fields.HTMLField({ initial: "" }),
        hairColor: new fields.StringField({ initial: "blue" })
      }),
    }
  }
}

// We can have branching inheritance; both VillainData and HeroData extend CharacterData
class HeroData extends CharacterData {
	static defineSchema() {
  	const characterData = super.defineSchema();
    return {
    	...characterData,
      goodness: new fields.SchemaField({
        value: new fields.NumberField({ initial: 5 }),
        max: new fields.NumberField({ initial: 10 })
      }),
    }
  }
}

class VillainData extends CharacterData {
	static defineSchema() {
  	const characterData = super.defineSchema();
    return {
    	...characterData,
      wickedness: new fields.SchemaField({
        value: new fields.NumberField({ initial: 5 }),
        max: new fields.NumberField({ initial: 100 })
      }),
    }
  }
}
```


### Type specific logic

Historically, developers either used proxies and/or typeguards to implement type-specific logic; maybe both `weapon` and `consumable` should work with `item.use()`, but the specifics differ by type. Data models allow you to leverage conventional polymorphism; a built-in and great example of this is `TypeDataModel#prepareBaseData` and `TypeDataModel#prepareDerivedData`. The general flow of data preparation is covered in [From Load to Render](/en/development/guides/from-load-to-render#clientdocument).

Returning to our earlier example of Heroes, Villains, and Pawns, we might have some generic logic in `Actor#prepareData`, but need to do specific calculations with a Hero's goodness score or a Villain's wickedness score. We can funnel those calculations to `HeroData#prepareDerivedData` and `VillainData#prepareDerivedData`, not worrying about checking `this.type === "hero"` and the like.

With the `weapon` and `consumable` example, we could have `MyItem#use` run `if (this.system.use instanceof Function) this.system.use()`; if it's an instance of a function, it will run, otherwise we could throw an error in console or perform some default method.

A key reason to use this pattern over typeguards and proxies is it allows module developers to leverage module sub-types; you won't know all the possible `type` values and their corresponding `system` setup, but you can check if the `system` object supports the operation you're trying to do.

### Data Models for Settings

[Settings](/en/development/api/settings) can take a data model as an argument when registered, allowing  you to have a strongly typed data.

### ValidateJoint

[API reference](https://foundryvtt.com/api/classes/foundry.abstract.DataModel.html#validateJoint)

The `DataModel.validateJoint` method is a property of data models that can be useful when handling complex, interlocked data. It's both called by the parent data model as well as any data models inside, such as the `TypeDataField` that represents the `system` field of documents and any `EmbeddedDocumentField` instances. If the validation fails, the method should throw an error.

Some examples of its use in Foundry's code include:
- Validating that a `DrawingDocument` has some visible content.
- Validating that a `Folder` does not contain itself.
- Validating that a `Macro` has valid javascript if it is a script macro.

## Troubleshooting

Below are some of the common issues people run into with data mdoels.

### Registered Data Model isn't working

While data models do *mostly* offload their work to your javascript files, for the purposes of server side validation you *must* register the appropriate `type` in a json file. This is `system.json` or `template.json` files for systems, or the `module.json` file for modules.
