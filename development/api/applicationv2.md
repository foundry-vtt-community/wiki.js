![Up to date as of v12](https://img.shields.io/badge/FoundryVTT-v12-informational)

Applications are a core piece of Foundry's API that almost every developer will have to familiarize themselves with. The ApplicationV2 class and its subclasses were introduced in Foundry V12, with the long-term goal of transitioning all applications to the new framework. The original [Application](/en/development/api/application) class isn't going away, but it is no longer the subject of active development.
