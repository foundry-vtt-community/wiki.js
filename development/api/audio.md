## API Interactions

General [document](/en/development/api/document) and [canvas](/en/development/api/canvas) manipulations are covered on their respective pages.

### Playing a sound

Playing a sound for the current user is done with the singleton AudioHelper class available at `game.audio` with the [play method](https://foundryvtt.com/api/classes/foundry.audio.AudioHelper.html#play). If you want to trigger a sound for *multiple* users, the [*static* play method](https://foundryvtt.com/api/classes/foundry.audio.AudioHelper.html#play-2) that is available at  `foundry.audio.AudioHelper.play` and `game.audio.constructor.play` (Both paths work equally well). Keep in mind that if you're calling these functions within a hook, that the hook may be called on only one client or on all clients and so it may be more appropriate to use the instance or static method.

```js
const src = 'some/audio/path.wav'

// play locally
game.audio.play(src);

// play on all connected clients
game.audio.constructor.play({ src }, true);
```
