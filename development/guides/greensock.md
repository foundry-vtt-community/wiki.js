## What Is GreenSock?
The [GreenSock Animation Platform](https://greensock.com/) ("GSAP" for short) is a robust JavaScript toolset that provides a host of powerful, easy-to-use, high-performance features for animating just about any visual element your module or system adds to the Foundry experience.  Foundry not only exposes the core GreenSock API from within its native code, it also includes the complete suite of premium "Club GreenSock" features for your use — many of which offer unique functionality especially well-suited to Foundry projects.

## Learning the GreenSock API
A tutorial on GreenSock's features is beyond the scope of this article, but don't be discouraged: GreenSock's documentation is excellent, and is directed at the beginner. Start [here](https://greensock.com/get-started/) for an introduction and feature overview, then head over to the [GSAP](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP) chapter of the [GreenSock Docs](https://greensock.com/docs/v3) and poke around: there are plenty of videos, examples, CodePen tutorials and the like to get you started.

## Implementing GreenSock in Your Foundry Project
Enabling GreenSock in your Foundry project, then accessing it from within your scripts, isn't especially well-documented and is the main purpose of this guide.  Fortunately, the process isn't difficult — follow these few quick steps, and you'll be off to the races:

### 1) Add a Reference in Your `system.json`/`module.json` File
Add `"greensock/dist/gsap.min.js"` as an entry in the `"scripts"` property of your `system.json`/`module.json` file. (If your system/module code is also included in the `"scripts"` array, place the GreenSock reference _before_ it:

```json
{
  "name": "mysystem",
  "title": "My System",
  ...
  "scripts": [
    "greensock/dist/gsap.min.js",
    "mysystem.js"
  ],
  ...
}
```
The `gsap` object serves as the access point for most of GreenSock's functionality, and is added to the global scope (i.e. you can access `gsap` from anywhere). In many cases, this will be all you need to accomplish your animation goals:
```javascript
// The gsap object can handle most animations on its own (see the GreenSock documentation for details):
gsap.to("#turn-me-orange", {backgroundColor: "orange", duration: 2});
```
### 2) Import Plugins to Unlock Even Greater Power
More specialized features are offered in the form of plugins (a full list of which can be found [here](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins)). Plugins should be imported by name and only as needed (to avoid unnecessary bloat), from `"/scripts/greensock/esm/all.js"`:

```javascript
import {
  MorphSVGPlugin,
  Physics2DPlugin,
  PixiPlugin,
  SplitText
} from "/scripts/greensock/esm/all.js";
```
Finally, it's good practice to register any plugins you import with the `gsap` object --- this isn't always necessary, but it never hurts:
```javascript
gsap.registerPlugin(MorphSVGPlugin, Physics2DPlugin, PixiPlugin, SplitText);
```

> A namespace collision currently exists between Foundry's own 'Draggable' class, and the 'Draggable' plugin offered by GreenSock.  To use GreenSock's 'Draggable' plugin (and its many awesome features), you must rename it to something else when you import it (I suggest "Dragger"):
{.is-warning}

```javascript
import {Draggable as Dragger} from "/scripts/greensock/esm/all.js";
gsap.registerPlugin(Dragger);
```
