# A. Overview
Your content here

# B. GitHub Account
In order for Foundry clients to be able to install your module, its files need to be hosted somewhere on the public internet (premium modules have extra layers on top of what we'll cover here).

Since most module developers need this hosting *and also* benefit from version control management, a free Git repository fills both of these needs nicely. Even if you don't ever use the Git parts, it's still a great way to host your module.

>There are two major services for this kind of thing, [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/). For reasons of familiarity, this guide will use GitHub. {.is-info}
