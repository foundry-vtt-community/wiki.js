# Code snippets for beginners

## Reasons/introduction
So what is the reason to start this page? 

While foundry has allready vibrant community and a really great discord channel (check it out!) the api documentation is geared toward relativly experienced programmers (my personal view!).

Then there are types like me. I know the basics of programming but never touched the basics of the programming languages and tools foundry VTT uses. 
I was aware about HTML, CSS and I know in general about object oriented programming but I am not versed in specifics or javascript.
I am learning by doing (as most experienced programmers also did) and ideally I would like to plug in some code snippets while knowing/learning enought about them to adapt them to my own needs.

So this is the experiment to collect code snippets and describe them detailed enough for others to use. This is a work in progress while developing my own system with foundry 9.255

If an experienced programmer sees fit to correct me or my descriptions feel free to do so.

Also if you have your own code snippets of interest feel free to contribute.
