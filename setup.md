Please check out the [Official Tutorial](https://foundryvtt.com/article/tutorial/) available from FoundryVTT!

In addition, we have created this guide to walk you through the basics of getting started.

## Downloading
Foundry is available via your user profile page on [FoundryVTT.com](https://foundryvtt.com).  Your user profile page is available by clicking your username on the top right of any page.  On this page, click on Purchased Licenses under your avatar and username.  You will find a list of download links for Windows, MacOS, and Linux under your licenses.

You will need to decide how you would like to host your foundry install, but there are 3 common setups: Self Hosted, Cloud Hosted and Partner Hosted. An [overview of these options](https://foundryvtt.com/article/hosting/) is available on the official site.

Once you have decided how you would like to host FoundryVTT, you should check the install guide for your set. We have a variety of [Setup Guides](/setup/hosting) for various cloud and self hosted options.

## Connecting
Foundry VTT is a self-hosted platform. This means that somebody is hosting a game on a server that they own or operate or rent. If you are not this person, you will need to contact the host for connection information. You will need an **IP & Port Number** or a **Domain Name**.

Once connected to the host's server, click on the **Select Player** dropdown, and click the username the host created for you. You may also need an **Access Key** before you can connect to the game.
