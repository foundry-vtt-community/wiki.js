<h1>Cloudflare Proxying &amp; Tunneling</h1>
<h2>A. Objective</h2>
<p>Cloudflare tunnels provide a way for users of your Foundry VTT server to access it securely via a domain name without needing Dynamic DNS, port forwarding, or dealing with SSL certificates. This works equally well on Windows, Mac, or Linux.</p>
<p>At the end of this you will have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Foundry server that is able to be connected to via a domain name (and not an IP!)</li>
  <li>A Foundry server whose public IP is shielded with the help of Cloudflare (very helpful for servers hosted on your local network)</li>
  <li>Full end-to-end encryption of data to shield your passwords from prying eyes</li>
</ul>
<h2>B. Requirements</h2>
<p>Before getting started, you need to have at least a few things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Created a free Cloudflare account (<a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up">sign up</a>).</li>
  <li>An already existing &amp; <i>working</i> FoundryVTT server instance <a href="/en/setup/linux-installation"><u>properly configured</u></a> without TLS enabled.</li>
</ol>
<h2>C. Process</h2>
<p>The logical flow from start to finish is to move an existing domain or purchase a new one in Cloudflare. Then, we'll set up a tunnel from your server to Cloudflare and test connectivity.</p>
<h3>Part 1: Set up your domain in Cloudflare</h3>
<p>1. If you already own a domain, log into your Cloudflare account and begin linking your domain through Cloudflare by following <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/">these instructions</a>. You can decline any offer of paid plans, as everything you need is in the free plan.</p>
<p>2. If you don't already own a domain, purchase one through Cloudflare <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up">here</a>. Cloudflare sells them at cost, which ranges from $6 (US) per year to $30 per year.</p>
<p><strong><u>Note:</u> Wait at least 15 minutes before continuing. Sometimes you may have to wait up to 24 hours before the DNS settings are successfully changed. You will be notified when the nameservers are properly navigated to Cloudflare. Continue AFTER these have successfully been changed.</strong></p>
<h3>Part 2: Setting up the Cloudflare Tunnel&nbsp;</h3>
<p>1. Follow the instructions <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/">here</a> through step 1 to install <code>cloudflared </code>on the same computer/server as your Foundry installation.</p>
<p>2. After <code>cloudflared</code> is installed and connected, choose the “Public Hostname” option, select your domain name, leave the path blank, set the Type to “HTTP" and enter “localhost:30000” where 30000 is the port Foundry is running on. If you plan on using your domain for anything other than foundry, you can add a subdomain if you wish, such as <code>foundry.example.com</code>.</p>
<p>3. Assuming everything went to plan, you should be able to refresh the webpage that has the named tunnel you just created and you should see a status of “Active”. If not, you may have to look up the docs, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/">here</a> and see if something may have gone wrong.</p>
<h3>Part 3: Testing Connectivity</h3>
<p>1. Ensure your foundry server is running.</p>
<p>2. Navigate in your web browser to domain URL.</p>
<p><strong>And that should be it! If you get any errors, please refer to any of the linked documentation from Cloudflare or search Google for your specific error.</strong></p>
