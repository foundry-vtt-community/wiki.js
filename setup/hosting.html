<h1>Hosting</h1>
<p>Methods of hosting and setting up networking so you can get started with Foundry VTT!</p>
<p>Please note that most methods here will not be officially supported by Foundry VTT, and you are unlikely to get any help if you ask on the official Discord server. Any guides on this wiki are followed at your own risk, and may be out of date.</p>
<p>Each list is in no particular order, and you should read the whole page before starting any guide.</p>
<h2>Official Resources</h2>
<p>Please see the official website's articles before returning here. The methods and options here will always be better supported and often easier to get up and running.</p>

<h2>Escaping Restrictive Networks</h2>
<p>If port forwarding won't work for you, some of these options might. They are in no particular order, and are used at your own risk. Some may expose your computer to the internet in ways that bypass firewalls that keep you safe.</p>
<p>All of these options will require having already installed and set up Foundry VTT.</p>
